# UnityFeastPrototype
A very simple prototype where I test the mechanic of players exponentially increasing size after "feasting" on small objects. Inspired by the champion Cho'Gath from League of Legends.

## Controls:
- **W, A, S, D** keys for movement
- Aim at a cube and press **R** to feast on it

## TODO:
There's a few things I want to add to this prototype to make it more interesting:
- Challenge (some blocks fight back)
- Gradually increase health so that the health increase when feasting isn't so jarring
- More satisfying feast ("reel in" victims with tongues, have cooldown so this can't be spammed)
