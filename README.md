# UnityFeastPrototype
A very simple prototype where I test the mechanic of players exponentially increasing size after "feasting" on small objects. Inspired by the champion Cho'Gath from League of Legends.

## Controls
- **W, A, S, D** keys for movement
- Aim at a cube and press **R** to feast on it

## TODO
There's a few things I want to add to this prototype to make it more interesting:
- Challenge (some blocks fight back)
- Gradually increase health so that the health increase when feasting isn't so jarring
- More satisfying feast ("reel in" victims with tongues, have cooldown so this can't be spammed)

![Once the player starts consuming more innocent blocks, they will get much bigger.](https://github.com/Fredrick117/UnityFeastPrototype.git/Screenshot2.png?raw=true)
![The blocks will flee as far from the player as possible, sometimes even falling off the map!](https://github.com/Fredrick117/UnityFeastPrototype.git/Screenshot3.png?raw=true)
